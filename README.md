Description
In this project, the Arctic ocean is simulated. The life forms are animals (polar bears, seals, whales, cods, planktons) and plants (algae). Animals are gendered and polar bears, whales and seals only reproduce when they met a partner of different gender. The time in simulation is divided into night and day. While planktons, cods and plants are active all the time, whales and polar bears only act during the day, and seals only act during the night. Plants grow in a certain rate and can breed. The weather is defined by temperature and state (sunny, snowing or raining). When it is raining, plants grow faster. Both animals and plants do not move or reproduce when it is snowing. Diseases can infect and spread among certain animal species, which may result in animalsâ€™ death. Infected animals can also be cured with a probability.
